=========

Ace WebGL is a game engine / tech demo for the WebGL technology. It is a project I do for my studies at the UAS Technikum Vienna, including features like Level of Detail and Alpha Blending.

Works best in Chrome. Not as fast, but also works in Firefox. You need an up-to-date version of these browsers.

Controls: WASD + Mouse

Click for fullscreen and mouse lock.

The red cube in the middle changes its mesh + texture (from red to blue) depending on the distance (Level of Detail).
